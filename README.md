# Traffic safety system

## Open this project in VS Code

Open `C:\project\CAPSTONE PROJECT` as the workspace folder. The workspace should
show the application source, Streamlit dashboard, data, model, uploads, and
evidence folders in Explorer.

## Set up from Windows Terminal

```powershell
cd "C:\project\CAPSTONE PROJECT"
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

The `.env` file is optional for the default local SQLite configuration. Do not
put database passwords or other secrets in source files.

## Run the applications

Run the main FastAPI traffic safety system:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.main
```

It prints the web dashboard, API explorer, and REST API URLs in the terminal.
Use `Ctrl+C` in that terminal to stop it.

The separate read-only Streamlit viewer for the local database and violation
records can be started with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

In VS Code, use **Terminal → Run Task** and choose either app task.

```

The primary FastAPI application uses paths relative to this project root, so
database files, model weights, uploads, and evidence stay in their respective
folders even when it is launched with `python -m src.main`.
